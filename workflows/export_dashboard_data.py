"""
Export Dashboard Data — generates summarized JSON snapshots for the admin dashboard.

Runs on Jetson after processing, writes JSON files that can be:
  1. Served from a local Streamlit app (reads JSON directly)
  2. Pushed to Netlify/Vercel as static JSON API (no Jetson needed)
  3. Uploaded to S3/R2/GitHub Pages as a static data layer

The dashboard reads these pre-computed snapshots instead of querying
the DB directly — fast loads, works offline, deployable anywhere.

Usage:
    python workflows/export_dashboard_data.py

    # Push to Netlify (requires NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN + NETLIFY_SITE_ID in .env)
    python workflows/export_dashboard_data.py --push-netlify

    # Custom output directory
    python workflows/export_dashboard_data.py --output-dir /tmp/dashboard_data

Cron (Thursday 11:30 PM, after processing):
    30 23 * * 4  cd /home/redwan/ai_industry_signals && python workflows/export_dashboard_data.py --push-netlify >> /var/log/export.log 2>&1
